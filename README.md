fund raise like a career politician ;)

(1) download and install python 2.7:

https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

(2) download the following modules for python: requests, urllib2, zipfile, os, stringio, csv, sys, lxml, html, time, openpyxl, workbook

example -- in your command prompt/terminal type:

pip install requests

(3) download the fec electronic data miner (you can right click and save link as)

(4) start mining the data by typing in your command prompt or terminal:

python fec_data_miner.py

(5) clean your spreadsheets so that:

column a = last name 
column b = first name 
column f = city 
column g = state

(6) download the phone number harvester

(7) in lines 6, 7, and 25 change the workbook names (currently: ch4llengertv.xlsx, ch4llengertv, ch4llengertv.csv -- change to: yourfilename.xlsx, yourworkbookname, yourfilename.csv)

(8) start harvesting phone numbers by typing in your command prompt or terminal:

python phone_number_scraper.py

if everything has been done correctly then a new comma serparated value (.csv) file will be created that will include the phone numbers of individual donors

(9) call the donors (make somewhere between 500-1000 calls per day) and ask them for their support

(10) mail or email the people who ask for more information and also send something like palm card and a preaddressed remit envelope for them to send back

(11) wait about a week and the remit envelopes will start rolling in

good luck!
